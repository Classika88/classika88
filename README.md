## 😄 About me

✌️ My name is Iryna. Programming for me is like magic! This is when you can make amazing and beautiful things out of nothing! I continue to master programming languages ​​in order to be able to implement any idea of ​​the client.

🎓I have experience in HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Also I have two team projects and two individual projects. In one project I was been a scrum-master, and we develop an Filmoteka site, using JS, HTML5, and CSS. I enjoyed learning something new, I want to grow up as a specialist and develop more difficult websites.

👩‍💻 I’m currently study in GoIT school.
